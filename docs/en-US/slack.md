We have a free slack workspace available at [https://vvv-local.slack.com](https://vvv-local.slack.com). This is where VVV contributors can organise and work on VVV. We also have a support channel for asking VVV related questions!

_Note this is not a general vagrant help resource._

All users of the slack workspace agree to abide by our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

[Join the VVV slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/vvv-local/shared_invite/zt-3k7ma97xw-3emggaVp4tZhKpa2NznUQQ).

If the invite link does not work, another person on the slack workspace can invite you, or you can raise an issue if the invite link above has expired. Note that as this is an unpaid Slack workspace there is limited message history available.
