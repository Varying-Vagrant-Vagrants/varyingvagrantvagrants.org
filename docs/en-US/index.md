## Helpful Extensions

Support for custom init scripts and site configurations allows for some great extensions of VVV core.

* [Variable VVV](https://github.com/bradp/vv) automates setting up new sites, setting up deployments, and more.
* [WordPress Meta Environment](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment) is a "collection of scripts that provision the official WordPress.org websites into a Varying Vagrant Vagrants installation."

## Custom Dashboards

The dashboard provided by VVV allows for easy replacement by looking for a `www/default/dashboard-custom.php` file. The community has built several great dashboards that may be more useful than the bare info provided by default:

* @topdown's [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/topdown/VVV-Dashboard)
* @leogopal's [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/leogopal/VVV-Dashboard)
* @stevenkword's [VVV Dashboard Custom](https://github.com/stevenkword/vvv-dashboard-custom)
* @goblindegook's [VVV Material Dashboard](https://github.com/goblindegook/vvv-material-dashboard)
