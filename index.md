VVV is an open source local development environment focused on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), powered by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).

VVV is ideal for developing themes and plugins as well as for [contributing to WordPress core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/).

## Objectives

* Approachable development environment with a modern server configuration.
* Stable state of software and configuration in default provisioning.
* Excellent and clear documentation to aid in learning and scaffolding.

Read more about the [history of VVV](docs/en-US/history.md), the [governance of the project](docs/en-US/governance.md), and [how you can contribute](docs/en-US/contributing.md).

## Requirements

VVV requires recent versions of both Vagrant and VirtualBox to be installed.

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is a "tool for building and distributing development environments". It works with [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization) software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to provide a virtual machine sandboxed from your local environment.

In addition to VirtualBox, provider support is also included for Parallels, Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, and VMWare Workstation. _We also have experimental Docker support._
